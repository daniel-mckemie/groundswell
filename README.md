# Groundswell for 4 Snare Drummers and Electronic Sounds

- Groundswell is written for 4 Snare Drummers. Each drummer picks one bar to read, and is placed
  at that point on the stage (ie. Player 1 is the left most bar, they will be positioned stage RIGHT, etc.). The
  extremes of the stage must
  be used. A variations exists where the drummers may be placed surrounding the audience.
  
- Players are to BUZZ ROLL in tandem with the animated gestures. These rolls can vary in speed, be
  played open or closed, etc., but must stay as a defined BUZZ ROLL. Single stroke rolls are
  NOT acceptable. Players should also only use drumsticks, and use only those sticks throughout the
  performance.
        
- The intensity of the color is related to dynamics (ie. white = not playing, black/red = loudest). When a
  BLACK color bar appears, the player plays along the snares (12 to 6 o'clock). When a RED color bar appears,
  the player plays against the snares
  (3 to 9 o'clock).
        
- Some gestures move quickly, it is okay if the player is staggered with the entrances and exits of their
  part, it is also acceptable to rest during an ENTIRE duration, though it should be avoided.
        
- Players may choose to silently engage snares off and on, or do so with authority. This decision can change,
  but one extreme has to be decided upon before taking action.
        
- It is desired that the drums used in performance be very resonant (steel shells, etc.) and be tuned to a Eb
  major/minor triad, or resonate with Eb in some regard.
            
- Dedicated to my friend Ryan Ross Smith for encouraging me to FINALLY write an animated score!
- There is a 20 second pause before the piece begins...
